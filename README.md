# Bots

TODO: Describe your gem

## Installation

Install the gem by executing:

```term
    $ gem install bots
```

To use this bot, we must add the `~/.jambots` directory to the `PATH` of our system.

## Usage

### Create a new bot

```term
    $ bot new [BOT_NAME]
```

The previus command creates a bot executable with the name `BOT_NAME` in the directory
`~/.jambots` that is used to store bots and their histories.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
