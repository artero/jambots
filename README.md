# Jambots CLI

:warning: **Important notice:** This gem is in an early stage of development. Changes in commands or class interfaces may be introduced in future versions. Use it at your own risk and make sure to stay up-to-date with updates. :warning:

Jambots is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with chatbots powered by OpenAI's GPT. It allows you to create new chatbots, manage chatbot conversations, and send messages to chatbots.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```
gem 'jambots'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install jambots
```

You'll need to create the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY with the value of your OpenAI API Key.

For instance if you use bash:

```
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

### initialize a jambots path

After installing the gem, you need to initialize Jambots:

```
$ jambots init
```

options:
- `--path` or `-p`: Initialize a jambots directory in specific path.
- `--globally` or `-g`: Creates the jambots directory in the uses' root directory.

This command will generate a Jambots directory with the default bot directory named jambot.

By default, this command initializes a Jambots directory in the current directory. However, you can use the `--path` or `--globally` options to create it at different paths.



#### The Jambot path

When you execute the subcommands jambots new or jambots chat without the `--path` option, Jambots will check for the existence of the `./.jambots` directory, and if not found, it will check for `~/.jambots.`

### Start a chat with the bot and send a message

```
$ jambots chat MESSAGE
```

Options:

- `--bot` or `-b`: Name of the bot (default: "jambot")
- `--conversation` or `-c`: Name of the conversation key
- `--path` or `-p`: Path where the bot and the conversation directory are located (default: "./.jambots or it it doesn't exist ~/.jambots")
- `--last` or `-l`: Continue with the last conversation created

#### Conversation example

```
$ jambots chat "Hello, how are you?"
```

With this command, we start a new conversation with the default bot. As a response, we will have an output like the following, for instance:

```
(ðŸ¤–)  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Hello! As an AI, I don't have personal feelings, but I'm here to help you
with any questions or information  you need. How can I assist you today?
20230506205026   â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
```

Apart from the bot response, we get the conversation key, in this case, 20230506205026.

To continue with the last conversation, you can use the `-l` (last) option. But if you want to continue with an older one, you can use the `-c` (continue) option with the conversation key.

As a reference, all the conversations are saved in the bot directory, inside the conversations directory. Each conversation has its own file in YAML format, for example, `./jambots/jambot/conversations/20230506205026.yml`.


### Create a new bot with the specified name

```
$ jambots new NAME
```

Options:

- `--path` or `-p`: Directory where the bot will be created
- `--model`: AI model to use (default: gpt-3.5-turbo)
- `--prompt`: Introduction text for the bot

When you create

This command creates a new bot in the default directory `~/.jambots`.

In this directory, you will find the directory for your new bot.

#### New bot Example

```
$ jambots new my_bot --path=./my_bots --model=gpt-4
--prompt="You will help me with development in Ruby"
```

To start a new conversation with this `new_bot`, use the `jambots chat` command with the appropriate options.

## Basic examples: Creating a new chatbot and chat with it

For example, if you want to create a bot called bender that acts like the Futurama character, you could execute a command like:

```
$ jambots new bender --prompt "You will act as Bender, the robot from the animated
series 'Futurama'. Bender is known for being sarcastic, inconsiderate, selfish,
and a party animal. However, he occasionally shows a kinder and more compassionate
side. Make sure to respond as if you were Bender in his interactions, using his
characteristic tone and style."

Bot 'bender' created  './.jambots/bender'
```

That command will create the bender bot, its directory has the following structure:

```
.jambots
â””â”€â”€ bender
    â”œâ”€â”€ bot.yml
    â””â”€â”€ conversations
```

The file `bot.yml` contains the bot configuration, and the conversations directory stores each conversation with the bot.

Now you can chat with `bender` using the `chat` subcommand. For instance, you can ask a question about Ruby:

```
$ jambots chat bender "How to concatenate 2 arrays in Ruby?"

(ðŸ¤–)  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Oh, meatbag! I see you're trying to do some programming. Alright, alright, I'll help you out. In Ruby, you can concatenate two arrays using the `+` operator. Here's an example:

array1 = [1, 2, 3]
array2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined_array = array1 + array2

Now, combined_array will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. There you go, human. Now let me get back to bending stuff and partying.

```

We can continue the conversation with the option `-l` (last).

```
$ jambots chat bender -l "And Strings?"

(ðŸ¤–)  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Ugh, fine. Concatenating strings in Ruby is easier than stealing booze.
Just use the `+` operator again. Check this out, meatbag:

string1 = "Bite "
string2 = "my shiny metal "
string3 = "butt!"
combined_string = string1 + string2 + string3

Now, combined_string will be `"Bite my shiny metal butt!"`. Done and done!
Now, if you don't mind, I got some partying to do.
